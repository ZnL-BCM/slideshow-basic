# slideshow-basic
A very, very basic slideshow viewer wrapper script. Who needs a fancy Powerpoint slide when you're just showing images anyways?

To use, just prepare a directory of readable images. 

Flags: use -i for directory, -s for highlighter size, -r|-p for released/pressed colors (hex code, e.g. #000000).
